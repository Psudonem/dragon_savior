I'm not sure if this is how you format this readme but here goes.\


Update 8:29 PM 12/26/2022

test.exe shows a fully loaded up game. woohoO! We have movement, and we can load in maps with a spawn point. No sprite graphics yet. I want to make sure the basic gameplay is there first before we do anything crazy with the graphics. I did write music tho (go figure). I'll post that in the next update.

OK. i think i'm going to call it. We can read data from the text file and display it on the screen but there seems to be some sort of issue in the read process.

made a simple map, doing some conversion scripting in python
not sure what lang to code the actual game in. for now, im gonna convert the map into a log ass string. strings are easy to read right? I'll parse that string into an array, and then use the array to render the graphics with.

The goal is to create a clone of Falcom's Dragon Slayer.  I need to refine the gameplay a bit before I fully put it into code. I might have to use game maker 7 for that.
